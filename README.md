# Weather-and-Airline-Delays
## Data Wrangling and Analytics Project

This repository contains an end to end data wrangling and analysis project exploring the relationship between weather conditions and airline delays. The project focuses on transforming raw, messy datasets into analysis ready tables using SQL, Python, and Excel, followed by structured analysis and reporting.

The emphasis of this project is not only on results, but on building a reliable and reproducible data pipeline across multiple tools.

## Project Objective

Airline delays are influenced by multiple operational and external factors, with weather being one of the most critical. The goal of this project was to:

- Integrate airline operations data with weather data  
- Clean, validate, and transform large datasets  
- Build a structured analytical workflow across tools  
- Enable downstream analysis through well designed tables  

---

## Data Sources

- Airline flight and delay data  
- Historical weather data  
- Publicly available datasets integrated through joins and transformations  

---

## Workflow Overview

The project follows a layered data wrangling approach:

### SQL
- Data extraction and joins  
- Schema design and intermediate tables  
- Feature creation and filtering logic  

### Python
- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Validation checks and exploratory analysis  
- Supporting feature engineering  

### Excel Power Query
- Additional transformations  
- Data quality checks  
- Final shaping for analysis  

### Reporting
- Consolidated analysis and documentation  
- Clear explanation of assumptions and methodology

## Tools and Skills Demonstrated

- SQL data modeling and joins  
- Python based data wrangling  
- Excel Power Query transformations  
- Data validation and quality checks  
- Analytical thinking and documentation

## Key Takeaways

- Real world data is rarely analysis ready  
- Most analytical value comes from thoughtful data preparation  
- Consistent logic across tools is critical for reliability  
- Clear documentation is as important as clean code
